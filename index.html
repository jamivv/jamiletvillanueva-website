        <div class="subheading mb-5">Education and TherapyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Over the past 8 years, I have been working as a tutor with children. They range from age 4 to 16 years of age. 
        I focus on enhancing each studentâ€™s knowledge and proficiency in whichever subject they choose to master. Most of the fields I teach 
        are Spanish and English language, which include how to write, read, understand, as well to apply it. I also teach math, science, and history.
        Depending on the weakness a child might have, I help them improve them and make sure it gets better over time; as well as to improve it with
        upcoming challenges. They have learned not to focus on their struggles rather on their strength to accomplish their obstacles. <br><br>

        I donâ€™t only teach children, yet I started to teach adults for about 3 years. Most of my clients are learning how to write, read, and 
        understand the language of Spanish. Most of these students have challenges of not even completing high school. With my help, they were 
        able to obtain the GED and improve their language in English. Most of these students can now talk, read, and write English properly. 
        With motivation and help these students have overcome many obstacles and have learned how to finish their assignments inside of class 
        as well as outside practice. <br><br>

        With my services, I also offer therapy sessions when customers are going through difficulty. For instance, some of the children I tutor
        went through the struggle of their parents getting divorced and did not react easily. they began to behave out of control and stopped listening. 
        However, with my help and services, they began to open and explain what was going on. After a couple of sessions, they began to get better grades
        and improve not only academically but as well in their behavior. For my clients that are adults I also provide therapy sessions that have helped 
        them understand and transition from living in their own country and coming to a new one. Most of these people couldnâ€™t progress due to not having
        a good transmission when moving to a different environment. However, most of these people are now working at good-paying jobs because they had 
        that motivation of progressing. I provide and have had the experience of providing help whether it is in improving a letter grade in school,
        interacting better with family, progressing in their life, and many more aspects that I help my clients acquire.At first, I might be hard to
        work with but as I get to know my clients I get to figure out and create strategies that can help them understand, learn, and apply for the work.
        It is not just about learning it once and then forgetting about it but rather applying it so that it can be retained and learned over time. That 
        is important because when learning you donâ€™t just stop at one topic but relate all the topics to one main learning. After these 8 years, I have met
        wonderful people that have made an improvement and their life and I hope I can still keep meeting more as I continue to gain more and more experience.
